    <h1>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
    <h3>So what is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
    <h1>CSS </h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red?

    <h1>JavaScript </h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.

    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

        JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
        
        JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
        
        Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
        Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
        Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications</p>
